# About

Hey everyone!

My name is Christian Andersen. I'm a Software Developer from Minnesota.

As log as I can remember, I have been facinated by technology (and how it works), specifically software. I took this interest and went to college for Computer Information Science at Minnesota State University, Mankato. After graduating in 2016 I moved up to Minneapolis, Minnesota to pursue my career in Software Development. In my free time I like to learn new technologies and work on side projects.

I plan to use this blog as a platform to write about what I've been working on, as well as documenting my time in other hobbies such as cooking, brewing, gaming, etc.

Hope you enjoy!
