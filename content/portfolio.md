# Public Projects
Below is a list of my public projects

## 112 on Broadway
I built a website for The 112 on Broadway in Albert Lea, Minnesota. I'm working on version 2.0 (a full rewrite) very soon.

[Visit the site](https://112onbroadway.com)

## Alexa Christmas
I built an Alexa app that allows you to wish Alexa a Merry Chritmas. Alexa will then tell you how to say Merry Christmas in another language
