Well after another run at a personal site / blog failing early this year (Migrated hosts and never quite got it set up again). I am taking another run at getting this going. The plan is to bring old blog posts over and start writing new ones. With the old blog never really getting to the point of what I wanted to do. I'm really excited to get that going here. I'm hoping that this can be a space that I can write my thoughts on different things from all of my hobbies.

I plan on writing often and not just thoughts but hopefully tutorials and other things.

Feel free to reach out at anderc(at)protonmail(dot)com if you have any questions/suggestions.
